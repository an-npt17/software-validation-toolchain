# VerifyThisBench: Generating Code, Specifications, and Proofs All at Once
**VerifyThisBench**, inspired by the annual VerifyThis Competition, is a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on end-to-end program verification tasks that require interpreting natural language problem descriptions, formulating formal specifications, generating code, and constructing correctness proofs. 

We also provide **VerifyThisBenchXS**, a relaxed variant where partial solution is provided.

### Dataset structure
- `/VerifyThisBench`: Main benchmark organized by **year**
  - Each challenge includes:
    - `description.txt`: natural language problem description
    - Sub-task files 

- `/VerifyThisBenchXS`: Relaxed benchmark with **partial solutions**
  - Organized by **year** and **tool**
  - Variants include:
    - `fill-implementation`, `fill-specification`, `fill-loop-invariant`
    - Files with `split` provide partial solution of that form
    - `solution.*`: human-written solution

- Other directories:
  - `/prompts`: example system and coherence prompts
  - `/envs`: Dockerfiles for tool-specific environments
  - `/scripts`: scripts for querying and evaluating LLMs

### Example Usage

#### Environment Setup

You can use either Docker or Nix to set up the verification environment:

**Option 1: Nix Flakes (Recommended - No Docker Required)**

For a native, reproducible development environment without Docker:

```bash
# Install Nix with flakes (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install

# Enter the development environment
nix develop

# Or use direnv for automatic activation
nix profile install nixpkgs#direnv
echo 'eval "$(direnv hook bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
direnv allow
```

See [NIX_SETUP.md](NIX_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions and benefits.

**Option 2: Docker**
To prepare the tool environment for a specific verification language, navigate to the corresponding directory and build the Docker image:
```
cd /envs/<tool_name>
docker build -t <image_name> .
```
Replace `<tool_name>` with the desired verification tool (e.g. FramaC) and `<image_name>` with the corresponding lowercase Docker image name (e.g. framac). Configure any image tags as applicable; these images are invoked by `/scripts/verify.py`. This will set up the sandbox required for running the verifiers.

#### Running Experiments
You need to set up the *API clients* and adjust *resource paths*, *Docker image names*, and *output paths* in the scripts.

To evaluate on VerifyThisBench
```bash
python query_with_feedback.py --tool dafny --attempt 5 --timelimit 60
```

To evaluate on VerifyThisBenchXS
```bash
python query_relaxed_with_feedback.py --attempt 5 --timelimit 60

```
### What's next?
We are working on extending the benchmark to support additional verification tools such as:

- [ ] CBMC  
- [ ] Verus  

Stay tuned for updates and more challenges!
