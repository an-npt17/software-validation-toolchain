\chapter{Related Work}

\section{Formal Verification Tools}

\textbf{Frama-C} \cite{framac} is a framework for static analysis of C programs, featuring the WP (Weakest Precondition) plugin for deductive verification using ACSL annotations. It has been successfully applied to industrial-scale verification projects.

\textbf{CBMC} \cite{cbmc} is a bounded model checker that verifies C/C++ programs by encoding them as SAT/SMT problems. It excels at finding bugs within bounded execution depths.

\textbf{KLEE} \cite{klee} is a symbolic execution engine built on LLVM that automatically generates test cases achieving high coverage. It has discovered hundreds of bugs in real-world software.

\section{Natural Language to Formal Specifications}

Recent work has explored using machine learning for specification generation. Nejati et al. \cite{nejati2019} used neural networks to convert requirements to temporal logic. However, most approaches focus on simple patterns rather than complex specifications.

\section{Integrated Verification Frameworks}

Tools like SeaHorn \cite{seahorn} and SV-COMP \cite{svcomp} provide integrated verification environments. However, they typically require manual specification writing and lack AI-powered translation capabilities.

Our work differs by providing a complete pipeline from natural language to verified code, leveraging modern large language models for specification generation.
